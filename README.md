## About Me

I am a builder and programmer for my VEX robotics team.

Beyond robotics, I have three years of leadership experience in my school's consortium council and currently serve as a Senior Councillor in my boarding school, where I have directed several major events. I also have experience building mobile and web applications for personal projects and school/boarding school events.

## Highlights & Experience

* **VEX Robotics:** Competed internationally at the VEX Robotics World Championships twice. Local awards include the Excellence Award (Middle School), Tournament Champion, Judges Award, and Amaze Award at the Singapore VEX Nationals.
* **Leadership:** Held leadership roles in my consortium and boarding school's council, with experience in project management and event planning.
* **Technical Skills:** Hands-on experience in mechanical design, programming (C++, Python), and digital design (Fusion 360) for robotics.

## Current Focus

* Exploring applications at the intersection of AI and robotics.
* Building personal projects to deepen my skills in web and mobile development.
* Continuing to compete in VEX, focusing on advanced design, code optimisation and team strategy.
